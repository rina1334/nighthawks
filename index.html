            <p>Our team is capable of scoring 1 preloaded sample and 3 samples from the field in the high basket<br> before teleop. <strong>This gives us a 64 point auto. <br><br></strong>
            During the teleop period, we plan on <strong>scoring samples in the high basket,</strong><br> but we are also able to score in the low basket. <br><br>
